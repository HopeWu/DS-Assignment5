# DS-Assignment5

## Project background
We do a project management system. Each project consists of several tasks. Those tasks have inter-dependancies among them. For a given project, the user inputs the all the relavant tasks along with the dependancies for each task and how many days each task takes to finish. At last, the user set a deadline and the system will output one or more sequences of tasks to do with sub deadlines for each.

We implement two underlying graphs. Each underlying graph can be implemented by either adjacent matrix or adjacent list.

## System design
Assuming we have two options of underlying graph structure to be used.
Assume all the tasks witin a project are connected. There is no left-alone task.

## How the system is used
